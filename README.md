Toolbox for estimating parameters in stochastic linear systems using the EM-algorithm

This is software accompanying the publication [1,2]
   
- A numerically efficient implementation of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for state space
models. Applied Mathematics and Computation 241, 2014, 222-232

Since publication, the package has evolved into a shared C library with Python bindings. The
following functions are already ported

- arfit: Fit parameters of in a VAR model.


A package of the toolbox for Arch Linux is available from the AUR [3].
